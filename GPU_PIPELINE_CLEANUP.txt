GPU PIPELINE CLEANUP - Progress Tracking
========================================
Date: 2026-02-25

GOAL: Remove dead code (GPU infrastructure never wired into render loop)
      Keep working code (TieredInstanceManager, BatchedDrawList, CPU culling)

FILES REMOVED:
--------------
[x] src/render/gpu_culler.h           - DELETED (never called)
[x] src/render/gpu_culler.cpp         - DELETED (never called)
[x] src/render/static_batch_manager.h - DELETED (never called)
[x] src/render/static_batch_manager.cpp - DELETED (never called)
[x] src/render/render_system.h        - DELETED (never called)
[x] src/render/render_system.cpp      - DELETED (never called)
[x] src/render/instance_types.h       - DELETED (unused structs)
[x] shaders/source/gpu_cull.comp      - DELETED (compiled but never loaded)

FILES UPDATED:
--------------
[x] CMakeLists.txt - Removed gpu_cull shader compilation
[x] docs/instancing-architecture.md - Added "Current Status" section explaining
    that the document describes FUTURE GPU-driven architecture, while current
    implementation is CPU-driven and working correctly.

WORKING CODE (KEPT):
--------------------
[x] TieredInstanceManager - Tier-aware SSBO uploads with triple-buffer support
[x] BatchedDrawList - Per-tier batching via BatchKey.tier
[x] RenderListBuilder - CPU frustum culling
[x] InstanceTier enum in object.h - Static/SemiStatic/Dynamic/Procedural
[x] Object.bDirty - Mutable dirty flag for SemiStatic tier
[x] SyncTransformsToScene - Marks SemiStatic dirty on transform change

BUILD STATUS:
-------------
[x] Release build - PASSED (no warnings except unused parameter)
[x] Debug build   - PASSED (no warnings except unused parameter)

CURRENT ARCHITECTURE (HONEST):
------------------------------
CPU: Frustum cull -> Build batches -> Write visible to SSBO -> GPU: Instanced draw

All statistics are CPU-computable:
- Objects per tier (from Scene)
- Draws per tier (from BatchedDrawList)
- SSBO uploads per tier (from TieredInstanceManager)
- Culled count (from RenderListBuilder)

NOTES:
------
- The deleted files were NEVER in CMakeLists.txt source lists (except shader)
- They were dead code that was never compiled or linked
- gpu_cull.comp WAS being compiled but never loaded/used at runtime
- No GPU culling compute shader is currently active
- This is CORRECT for current scale (<100K objects)

FUTURE WORK (Phase 7):
----------------------
When needed for 100K+ objects:
1. Re-implement GPU culler with proper integration from start
2. Upload ALL objects to GPU (not just visible)
3. Compute shader frustum + occlusion culling
4. Indirect draw with GPU-written counts
5. GPU readback for stats (atomic counters)
