# Config folder

Application config files live here. The default config is `config.json` (created from code defaults if missing).

Run the app from the **project root** or from the **install directory** (e.g. `install/Debug`) so that `config/config.json` is found. Add more JSON configs here as needed; the app can be extended to load a chosen file via a command-line argument or env var.
