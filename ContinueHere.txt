# Continue here (alpha review — PC switch)

## Project
Vulkan PBR engine, Alpha v0.1.0. Single unified Scene (scene_unified); old scene.h / SceneNew / RenderListBuilder deleted.

## Build (use project scripts only)
  scripts/linux/build.sh --debug   # or --release
  scripts/linux/clean.sh
  ./install/Debug/bin/VulkanApp levels/default/level.json

## Key files
  ALPHA_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.txt   — full checklist (sections 1–2, 6, 8, 9 partly done)
  alpha_review/progress.txt    — what’s done, leftovers
  alpha_review/questions.txt  — open decisions, Q10 shader tasks

## Done so far
  - SceneUnified migration complete; scene.h, scene_new.*, render_list_builder.* deleted
  - Section 1 (architecture), Section 2 (is everything used), Section 8 (dead code) mostly done
  - Section 9: README/getting-started checked; Debug + Release build OK, no warnings
  - physics/script_component: “Not in alpha” in headers

## Next (unchecked in checklist)
  - Section 3: Efficiency (per-frame allocs, barriers, batching, culling)
  - Section 4: Vulkan correctness (barriers, descriptor writes, lifetime, validation)
  - Section 5: Shader/data layout (push constants, SSBO, bindings 0–8)
  - Section 6 remainder: procedural_mesh_factory TODO, animation/skinning doc, engine.cpp, config validation
  - Section 7: Guidelines (naming, no `!`, literals, include order)
  - Section 10: Internal docs, coding guidelines link
  - Section 11: Cursor rule; Section 12–13: improvements, scalability
  - alpha_review/questions.txt Section 10: global UBO, time_demo shader, descriptor writes 6–8

## If in doubt
  Ask the user. Use only project scripts for build/clean/setup.
